# Java microservices with Jenkins
**Jenkins in Short:**

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for building, deploying, and automating software development processes. It facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) by automating tasks such as building code, running tests, and deploying applications. Jenkins provides a web-based interface to define and manage pipelines and jobs, making it a powerful tool for automating various stages of software development and delivery.

**Using Jenkins with Spring Boot Java Microservices:**

To integrate Jenkins with your Spring Boot Java microservices, you can set up a Jenkins pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes. Here's a simple guide for your Git README file:

1. **Create a Jenkins Pipeline:**

   - Install Jenkins if not already installed and set it up.
   - Create a new Jenkins pipeline project.
   - In your pipeline configuration, specify the Git repository URL for your Todos-Rest-api microservice.

2. **Configure Build Steps:**

   - Define build steps in your Jenkinsfile (usually located in your project's root directory).
   - Use Maven for building your project. Here's an example stage for building:

     ```groovy
     stage('Build') {
         steps {
             sh 'mvn clean package'
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Database Configuration:**

   - Ensure that your Jenkins environment has access to Oracle 11g, whether it's running on the same server or you're connecting to a remote database.
   - Provide the necessary database connection information in your `application-test.yaml`.

4. **Testing:**

   - Run JUnit 5 tests as part of your Jenkins pipeline. You can use the `test` phase in your Maven build.

     ```groovy
     stage('Test') {
         steps {
             sh 'mvn test'
         }
     }
     ```

   - Ensure that your database integration tests use the `application-test.yaml` with the test profile, as you mentioned.

5. **Deployment:**

   - If you want Jenkins to handle deployments, set up a deployment stage in your Jenkins pipeline.
   - This stage can involve copying the built JAR or WAR file to a deployment target (e.g., a server or container) and starting your Spring Boot application.

6. **Active Profile:**

   - Ensure that your application picks up the correct profile (e.g., "test") when running integration tests in the Jenkins pipeline. This should be configured in your `application-test.yaml`.

7. **Pipeline Execution:**

   - Trigger the Jenkins pipeline manually or automatically whenever changes are pushed to your Git repository.

8. **Monitoring and Notifications:**

   - Configure Jenkins to send notifications or alerts (e.g., email, Slack) based on pipeline success or failure.
   - Consider using Jenkins plugins for integrating with external tools, such as SonarQube for code analysis or Docker for containerization.

9. **Documentation:**

   - Keep your Jenkins pipeline script (Jenkinsfile) well-documented within your project's README or in the pipeline itself. Explain how to set up and configure Jenkins for your microservice.

10. **Security and Access Control:**

    - Ensure that Jenkins is secure and access control is properly configured to protect sensitive data and control who can run pipelines.

Remember that this is a high-level overview, and the actual setup may vary depending on your specific requirements and infrastructure. Consult Jenkins documentation and best practices for more detailed information.
